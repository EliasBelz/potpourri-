Then, in docs/audit_changes.md you should describe any changes you made to your app in response to the audit, or any changes you decided to not make (e.g. if you disagree with an audit recommendation).

We decided to change our user location icon to have a darker border to help it stand out from the map background. This turned out to be kind of complicated in Flutter and might have required us to introduce another external package, so instead we just added a black shadow behind the yellow icon to help it stand out. This worked really well--the yellow pops much more agains the dark background and is much easier to parse out from all of the background noise behind it from the map.

We took the advice of the auditors regarding screen readability and basically slapped a semantic tag onto every element we could think of. Now our app passes a screenreader audit much more thoroughly than before!

We decided NOT to make adjustments to our app to make the location data more robust. This is not because we don't think this fail behavior wasn't a good point--it's moreso because window dialogs and permissions aren't something we've handled much before, and don't feel it's in the scope of this project within the current timeline.
