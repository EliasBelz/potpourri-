You must establish the need that your app addresses.

You can do this in several ways:

By gathering and synthesizing existing evidence (e.g. from prior research, news stories, etc.) to make a persuasive argument for the existence of a problem that your app will help with.
By conducting interviews with people who are among the population your app is meant to be helpful for. For example, if your app is intended to help people with a specific disability, you should interview people with that disability to understand their needs. Your evaluation must also include them.
By critiquing an existing app that addresses the need, and describing how the app could be improved.

Whichever route you choose, you should describe your approach, evidence, etc. in a file called docs/need.md.

Our app addresses the need for UW students, faculty, visitors, etc to quickly determine which buildings have decent bathroom facilities, and which are worth avoiding. The idea for the app arose from each of the team members' experiences as new students on the UW campus, unfamiliar with most of the buildings and unwilling to individually check out new buildings for good bathrooms if we weren't already there. We additionally spoke to other students in the 340 class as well as friends also attending UW, to verify the experience was shared across different groups (freshman, seniors, transfers). 

A similar app exists on the Itunes App Store called Poop Maps, but its function and intent differs greatly. While users can log the locations of their poops and review them, they are reviewing the poops themselves and not the locations. There is also no way to aggregate location data or easily share it with other groups of people interested in these locations.
