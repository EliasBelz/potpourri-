Our app addresses the need for UW students, faculty, visitors, etc to quickly determine which buildings have decent bathroom facilities, and which are worth avoiding. The idea for the app arose from each of the team members' experiences as new students on the UW campus, unfamiliar with most of the buildings and unwilling to individually check out new buildings for good bathrooms if we weren't already there. We additionally spoke to other students in the 340 class as well as friends also attending UW, to verify the experience was shared across different groups (freshman, seniors, transfers). 

A similar app exists on the Itunes App Store called Poop Maps, but its function and intent differs greatly. While users can log the locations of their poops and review them, they are reviewing the poops themselves and not the locations. There is also no way to aggregate location data or easily share it with other groups of people interested in these locations. For this reason, we consider our application to be addressing a sufficiently different need than this existing resource.
