We SUS tested our app with other students in 340 via one of our laptops (Mac), as well as a few of our family members to get us up to 9 people. Our aggregated results are as follows:

Average Usability score: 81.11111

Average Learnability score: 81.94444

Average Usability Subscore: 80.90277

While the inidividual reviews varied from person to person (and there was more variance between our 340 classmates and those of our family members that provided us with scores), each of these total scores gave us remarkably consistent averages! 

In general, we received positive feedback for the design of the app--it was easy for users to figure out how to look around the map, and understood that clicking on a map pin would take them to a page with reviews. All of our testers were able to leave a quick review, look at other locations near them, and browse buildings thorugh the list.

We received feedback that it would be nice if the data persisted across accesses, or was hosted on a server so users could see reviews other than the mock data we filled teh current program with. We agree with this assessment and while it's not within the scope of this project within the current timeframe, it would be a good extension to the existing framework and may be something we choose to work on in the future.
