# Potpourri: A UW Bathroom Mapper

By Elias Belzberg, Kathryn Koehler, and Fernando Pazaran for CSE 340.

## Description
The University of Washington's Seattle campus sprawls across more than 600 acres, and can be daunting to navigate for newcomers. Many mapping services can help students get from one building to another--but can these apps tell them which of the bathrooms suck? This application allows users to leave reviews of bathrooms in each building to later reference, saving them from the horror of walking into dimly lit, poorly maintainedd, echoey facilities.

### Features
- Pannable/zoomable map of UW shows locations of commonly accessed buildings with bathrooms
- Move the map as the location of the user changes
- Buildings with bathrooms also listed in sidebar drawer for quick access, organized by average rating
- Each listed bathroom allows users to browse reviews, leave reviews, and see the location isolated on a map
- Reviews are aggregated to display an average star rating
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" random bathroom selection

## Data Design

## Data Flow
describe the data structures you designed to hold user data, and how you architected your app to use Providers (or another framework, like Bloc) to propagate changes to these data in a reactive way.


# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
